Use a bigger list
What haven't you enumerated?
What seems irrelevant?
Fuzz something
What do you own?
What's running?
How could they have been lazy?
Write the tool you need
Google something
Take the hard time
What have you left behind?
Reverse direction
Discover, don't invent
Invent
Take a break!
You can't be invisible. You can be camouflaged
If an alert triggers and no one sees it, did it happen?
Simplify your attack chain
You only need one
Begin with the end in mind
Graphs, not lines
Is this chess, or is this go? (the board game, not the language)
Challenge their assumptions
If it walked out the door, would they care?
Context: operational, process, level of access, background noise
Risk. Reward. Trade one, get one
The community has the answer
Take it back to the forge
It doesn't have to be perfect
